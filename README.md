# soxmerge
Merge two audio files using Sox and put them output in /tmp/out.mp3

### usage
copy two mp3 files into the base dir of the repo, name them file1.mp3 and file2.mp3 then run
```
make build
make run
```

the resulting file should be /tmp/out.mp3

this is a proof of concept, not certain if it will ever prove to be actually useful.  But it works!
